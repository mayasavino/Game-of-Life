FILES:

logic.c - logic for game of life
logic.h - header file for logic.c



PURPOSE: 

In this lab, we put everything we learned to the test to create Conway's Game of Life in C.



CONCLUSION:

    In this lab, we practiced working with arrays. There was no pair programming,
but I think it turned out okay anyway. 

    When the -x option to randomize colors is used, the program ends with a seg fault
about 50% of the time. I ran out of time to fix it. If it happens, you can re-run the
program and it will eventually run, and often it works the first time, but not every time.

    It was a good semester and I learned a lot.
